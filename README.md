## Run locally

Serve the site directory over HTTP:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory site
```

Open http://localhost:8080. No build step or backend is required. The SDK and runtimes use a pinned import map; downloads occur on first inference. Microphone capture requires localhost or HTTPS. SDK usage telemetry contains no input or output content.

## Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow publishes the site directory to GitHub Pages on pushes to main. Choose GitHub Actions as the Pages source.
